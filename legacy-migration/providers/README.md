# Legacy Service Migration for Providers

Provider Legacy Service Migration holds the migration scripts for migrating providers from CMR Legacy Service to CMR. 

The data migrated are all of the providers from legacy services.

The data calls the legacy services REST api parses those values into metadata documents inside of a subdirectory called providerMetadata. These can then be ingested into the CMR utilizing the new providers interface. This will enable us to store metadata on these providers and change this metadata by versioning a schema against it.
