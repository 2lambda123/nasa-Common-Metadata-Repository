# cmr-graph-db

Nodejs application to perform graph db operations in CMR

# Development Environment

## Prerequisites
* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
* [Tinkerpop](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/)

### Node
CMR graph-db runs on Node.js, in order to run the application you'll need to install nodejs.

Recommended: Use Homebrew

```
brew install node
```

### NPM
npm is a separate project from Node.js, and tends to update more frequently. As a result, even if you’ve just downloaded Node.js (and therefore npm), you’ll probably need to update your npm. Luckily, npm knows how to update itself! To update your npm, type this into your terminal:

```
npm install -g npm@latest
```

### Docker
Download docker on https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

### Gremlin Server
Gremlin Server provides a way to remotely execute Gremlin against one or more Graph instances hosted within it. We use the default Gremlin Server TinkerGraph db as our local development graph db. To start it, replace the <path_to_cmr_graphdb> with the path to your local CMR graph-db directory and run:

```
docker run -it -p 8182:8182 -v <path_to_cmr_graph-db>/data:/data tinkerpop/gremlin-server
```

### Gremlin Console
The Gremlin Console is a REPL environment that allows user to experiment with a variety of TinkerPop-related activities, such as loading data, administering graphs and working out complex traversals. We use Gremlin Console to connect to the Gremlin Server and explore the graph db in local development. To start it, run:

```
docker run -it -p 8182:8182 --network host tinkerpop/gremlin-console
```

### Graphexp
Graphexp is a lightweight web interface to explore and display a graph stored in a Gremlin graph database, via the Gremlin server. This is an easy way to visualize nodes and edges in the graph database.
Clone the graphexp repository at https://github.com/bricaud/graphexp

## Build
```
npm install
```

## Run
To invoke the bootstrap function and load data into your Gremlin server from the CMR run the following command:
```
npm run bootstrap
```

# Test
To run the test suite one time run
```
npm run test
```

To run the test suite in watch mode, run
```
npm run test -- --watch
```
