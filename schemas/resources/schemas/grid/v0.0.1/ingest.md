Grid concepts can be created or updated by sending an HTTP PUT with the metadata to the URL `%CMR-ENDPOINT%/grid/<native-id>?provider=<provider-id>`. The response will include the [concept id](#concept-id) and the [revision id](#revision-id). Filename is the json document containing the record to be ingested

```
curl -v -XPOST \
-H "Content-Type:application/vnd.nasa.cmr.umm+json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer XXXX" \
"%CMR-ENDPOINT%/grid/sampleNativeId?provider=CMR_ONLY" \
-d @sampleGrid.json
```
