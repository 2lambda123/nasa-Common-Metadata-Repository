  ;; Notes on using ring code:

  ;; We can reuse the ring code for parsing body parameters like so (instead of
  ;; writing our own) but all the values must be exactly correct in case and setup
  ;; Use the following as an example to understand what is expected of a request object
  ;; and what you will get back.
  (let [body-stream (clojure.java.io/reader (char-array "p1=a&p2=b"))
        request {:headers {"content-type" "application/x-www-form-urlencoded;anything-allowed-here"}
                 :body body-stream}]
    (ring.middleware.params/assoc-form-params request "UTF-8"))

  ;; and query paramas are simple and can be done as the following:
  (ring.middleware.params/assoc-query-params {:query-string "&keyword=value"} "UTF-8"))
